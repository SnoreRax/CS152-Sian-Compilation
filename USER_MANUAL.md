## Introduction

Trisakay is a tricycle riding app that allows both drivers and passengers to have a more convenient experience when it comes to commuting. For drivers, the app should allow them to more easily locate potential passengers along their chosen route. For passengers, the app should allow them to quickly identify drivers in their area that are along their chosen route so that they can more easily catch a ride. Overall, it should improve local commuting experiences for both drivers and passengers in subdivisions that have available tricycle riders in them.
